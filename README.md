# introduction-to-programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists

I apply the technique from the book _[Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org)_ by Zed A. Shaw _instruction_. _Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition (Zed A. Shaw)_. I take the book [Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Musicians-Digital-Artists-Creating/dp/1617291706) with slight differences; not always copy the exact same code with my study drills in my own. 

Here is how I attack my study drills in this [repository](https://github.com/elohimgv/study-drills-in-chuck). First, I decided to practice my skills and be better on that through find inspiration on books of physics and mathematics. For example coding the law of gravity of Isaac Newton and retirving some interesting sounds from that.
