I apply the technique from the book _[Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org)_ by Zed A. Shaw _instruction_. _Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition (Zed A. Shaw)_. I take the book [Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Musicians-Digital-Artists-Creating/dp/1617291706) with slight differences. 

1. [Basics: sound, waves, and ChucK programming.](https://github.com/elohimgv/introduction-to-programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists/tree/master/01_basics_sound_waves_and_chuck_programming)

2. [Libraries: Chuck's built-in tools](https://github.com/elohimgv/introduction-to-programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists/tree/master/02_libraries_chucks_built_in_tools)

3. [Arrays: arranging and accessing your compositional data](https://github.com/elohimgv/introduction-to-programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists/tree/master/03_arrays_arranging_and_accesing_your_data)

4. [Sound files and sound manipulation](https://github.com/elohimgv/introduction-to-programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists/tree/master/04_sound_file_and_sound_manipulation)

5. [Functions: making your own tools](https://github.com/elohimgv/introduction-to-programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists/tree/master/05_functions)

6. [Unit generators: ChucK objects for sound synthesis and processing](https://github.com/elohimgv/introduction-to-programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists/tree/master/06_unit_generators)

Here is how I attack my study drills in this [repository](https://github.com/elohimgv/study-drills-in-chuck). First, I decided to practice my skills and be better on that through find inspiration on books of physics and mathematics.
